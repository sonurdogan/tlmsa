Mapping mutations that comes from GDC to healthy sequence that comes from Uniprot, predicting possible SUMOylation by using SUMOnet which is pretrained sequantial deep neural network.

Requires:


SUMOnet -> https://github.com/berkedilekoglu/SUMOnet
 bioservices 


retrieveData.R -> retrieving data from GDC database and preprocessing data for mapping part.

tutorial.py -> tutorial for mapping mutations, predicting SUMOylation with SUMOnet.
