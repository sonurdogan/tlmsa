# tlmsa package

Mapping mutations that comes from GDC to healthy sequence that comes from Uniprot, predicting possible SUMOylation by using SUMOnet which is pretrained sequantial deep neural network.

Requires:
SUMOnet
bioservices 


retrieveData.R -> retrieving data from GDC database and preprocessing data for mapping part.
tutorial.py -> tutorial for mapping mutations, predicting SUMOylation with SUMOnet.
